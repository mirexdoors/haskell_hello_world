--Description
--We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?
--
--Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.
--
--Examples
--stringToNumber "1234" == 1234
--stringToNumber "605"  == 605
--stringToNumber "1405" == 1405
--stringToNumber "-7"   == -7

stringToNumber :: String -> Integer
stringToNumber str = read str :: Integer

--Trolls are attacking your comment section!
--
--A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
--
--Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
--
--For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
--
--Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

--The museum of incredible dull things
--The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

--Task
--Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

Let us consider this example (array written in general format):

ls = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]

Its following parts:

ls = [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]
ls = [1, 3, 6, 10]
ls = [3, 6, 10]
ls = [6, 10]
ls = [10]
ls = []
The corresponding sums are (put together in a list): [20, 20, 19, 16, 10, 0]

The function parts_sums (or its variants in other languages) will take as parameter a list ls and return a list of the sums of its parts as defined above.

Write a function toWeirdCase (weirdcase in Ruby) that accepts a string, and returns the same string with all even indexed characters in each word upper cased,
and all odd indexed characters in each word lower cased. The indexing just explained is zero based, so the zero-ith index is even, therefore that character should be upper cased.

The passed in string will only consist of alphabetical characters and spaces(' ').
 Spaces will only be present if there are multiple words. Words will be separated by a single space(' ').

Examples:
toWeirdCase "String"            `shouldBe` "StRiNg"
toWeirdCase "Weird string case" `shouldBe` "WeIrD StRiNg CaSe"
